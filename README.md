# Self-Experimentation with Ashwagandha Supplementation: Quantifying Effects on Sleep Quality and Stress Through Individual Tracking

This repository contains analysis and data from an N-of-1 self-experiment on the effects of daily ashwagandha supplementation on sleep quality and stress levels.

## Abstract

This report presents an n-of-1 study investigating the effects of daily ashwa-
gandha supplementation on sleep quality and stress levels. Using an ABAB
design across four weeks, we alternated between treatment (500mg ashwa-
gandha daily) and control phases. Sleep outcomes were measured via Apple
Watch tracking, while mood and stress were assessed twice daily using
self-reported ratings. Data were analyzed with visual inspection and non-
parametric statistical tests (Mannâ€“Whitney U). Results showed no statistically
significant differences between treatment and control phases for either sleep
or mood. Subjectively, the participant did not perceive improvements during
supplementation periods. These findings suggest that in this short-term self-
experiment, ashwagandha did not produce detectable effects. A longer follow-
up study, excluding disruptive external events and incorporating placebo
controls, would be needed to clarify potential impacts.
